# AI/DATA Project

This project consists of creating an IA that recognises normal, legitimate unusual and illegitimate unusual activities.

## DATA Description

We chose to use the logs of our PC. Indeed, we have recovered logs present in the files:  
- dpkg.log
- karn.log
- sys.log

In computing, a log file is used to store a history of events on a server, computer or application.
